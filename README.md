This repository contains a small learning project created to familiarise myself
with YOLO-based object detection and the general workflow involved in training a
model on a custom dataset.

Most of the experimentation and training for this project was carried out using
Google Colab.

## Goal of the project

Train a model for object detection using a custom dataset.
Work with annotated datasets and udo manual annotation.
Learn how datasets,training, and inference fit together.

## What I learned

Using YOLO for object detection
Training a model on multiple classes
Running  inference on sample images
Basic  structure for ML projects

## Tech Stack 
Python 
YOLO (Ultralytics)
OpenCV
